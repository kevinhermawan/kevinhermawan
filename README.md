## Hey there!

I'm Kevin, a passionate developer specializing in creating open-source AI apps such as [Ollamac](https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Ollamac) and [Canvas](https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Canvas). My focus lies in bridging the gap between Swift and advanced AI technologies, particularly [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation).

## Mission

My mission is to adapt complex AI frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com) and [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai) for the Swift ecosystem. This effort will enhance accessibility for Swift developers and optimize these frameworks for Apple platforms. Through the development of intuitive RAG libraries, clear documentation, and practical example projects, the ultimate goal is to empower Swift developers to seamlessly integrate advanced AI capabilities into iOS, macOS, and other Apple platforms.
